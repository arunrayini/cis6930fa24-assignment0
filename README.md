Name: Arun Kumar Reddy Rayini

# Assignment Description 

This project provides a tool to extract data from the FBI's Most Wanted API or a local JSON file, transforming it into a formatted output that separates key fields using a thorn (þ) character. The purpose of this tool is to cleanly and consistently display critical information such as the title, subjects, and associated FBI field offices of wanted individuals or cases.

Key Highlights
API Integration Pulls live data directly from the FBI’s API, supporting pagination to browse through multiple entries.

Local JSON Support Option to use a local JSON file for quick testing or offline functionality.

Formatted Output Converts data into thorn-separated values, a unique format that ensures clear, structured data presentation.

Graceful Handling of Missing Information Ensures that cases with missing fields, such as absent subjects or field offices, are handled correctly without breaking the output structure.

# How to install

To set up and run this project on your local machine, follow these steps
Initialize Project Environment Create and activate the virtual environment using pipenv

Command:pipenv install -e .
Install Dependencies Run the following command to install all necessary packages
Command - pipenv install

# How to run
The script can fetch data either directly from the FBI's API or from a local JSON file. Below are the commands to get started

1. Fetch Data from the FBI API
Use this command to pull and format data from the FBI's Most Wanted list
Command - pipenv run python main.py --page 1

**Replace 1 with the desired page number to retrieve data from different pages of the API.**

2. Use a Local JSON File
If you want to work with a local JSON file, use the following command

Command - pipenv run python main.py --file pathtolocalfile.json

Functionality Overview

The core of the project revolves around the following functions

retrieve_data(page_num)

Fetches data from the FBI's API for a specific page.
Raises an exception if the API request fails.

format_data(fetched_data)

Formats the retrieved data into thorn-separated values (þ), including fields for title, subjects, and field_offices.

Gracefully handles missing data, ensuring that empty fields are displayed correctly.

Main Script

Allows the user to either specify a page number to fetch from the API or provide a local JSON file for testing.

Running Tests

To ensure that all functionality works as expected, you can run the test suite using

Command - pipenv run pytest -v
This will execute the unit tests defined in the teststest_main.py file.
Known Issues and Considerations

API Availability If the FBI API is temporarily unavailable, the script will raise an error. Future updates could include error handling for retries.
Missing Data The script assumes that fields like title, subjects, and field_offices may sometimes be missing or empty, and it handles this by leaving the corresponding fields blank in the output.

# Bugs

Handling Missing Fields:When certain fields like subjects or field_offices are missing in the API response, the script leaves them blank in the output without notifying the user. This can cause confusion, especially when users expect complete data for every entry.

API Timeout Issues:Occasionally, the FBI API takes too long to respond or times out. Currently, the script does not handle timeouts or retries, leading to potential failures if the API is slow or temporarily unavailable.

# Assumptions:

API Structure Consistency:The script assumes that the structure of the API response will remain consistent. If any field names or data formats change, the script may fail as there is no dynamic handling for these types of changes.

Valid User Input:The script assumes that the user will provide valid inputs, such as a correct page number or a properly formatted JSON file. There is limited error handling in place for incorrect or invalid inputs.
